# firebase-login
## Firebase setup
Go to [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a project. Add a web app and copy the configuration in your clipboard.  
Then go to authentication and under sign-in methods enable email and password.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
After this you should see an error when you open the web app. Do what that error says and everything should work!

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
